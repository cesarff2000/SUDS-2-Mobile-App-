    <Text style={styles.text}>
      1.1 Purpose of the SUDS-2-U Platform.{'\n\n'}
      The SUDS-2-U Platform has been created to offer services (the "Services") to users requesting services to be performed (each, a " Client"). SUDS-2-U is a third party independent contractor to Clients and may engage certain individuals that have obtained the conditions required by the Site (you, in such capacity, a "Contractor") to perform Services for Clients. Under this Agreement, SUDS-2-U provides access to the Site to you in your capacity as a Contractor. Our services include performing Services for Clients, including recruiting and coordinating Contractors to perform such Services when appropriate. Clients post jobs and invite applications, which may be fulfilled by Contractors on behalf of SUDS-2-U. Contractors post profiles to compete to be selected for jobs. If a Client and SUDS-2-U agree on terms, a contract is formed between Client and SUDS-2-U, and between SUDS-2-U and any applicable Contractor, for the performance of such Services (each such contract, a "Service Contract"). SUDS-2-U collects payment from Clients in connection with their acceptance of a Contractor bid through the SUDS-2-U platform. SUDS-2-U then pays Contractors as appropriate in connection with Contractors' delivery of Services once the Work Product (as defined below) is accepted by Client.{'\n\n'}
      1.2 Eligibility.{'\n\n'}
      The use of the Site is available only to legal entities and persons who are at least eighteen (18) years old and are otherwise capable of forming legally binding contracts under applicable law. You represent, warrant and covenant that you are not (a) a citizen or resident of a country in which use or participation in the SUDS-2-U Platform is prohibited by law, decree, regulation, treaty or administrative act; (b) a citizen or resident of, or located in, a country or region that is subject to U.S. or other sovereign country sanctions or embargoes; or (c) an individual or an individual employed by or associated with an entity identified on the U.S. Department of Commerceʼs Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasuryʼs Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the Department of Stateʼs Debarred Parties List or otherwise ineligible to receive items subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, or other economic sanction rules of any sovereign nation (collectively, a " Prohibited Person"). You also hereby represent and warrant to SUDS-2-U that you are qualified and legally permitted to perform Services in the United States (a "Permitted Person"). If you are a Prohibited Person or not a Permitted Person, you may not use the Site, and you hereby agree to indemnify SUDS-2-U against any claims arising from any breach by you of this Section 1.2.

The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.{'\n\n'}
      15.8 Choice of Law.{'\n\n'}
      This Agreement and any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including but not limited to a Service Contract, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).{'\n\n'}
      15.9 Mediation/Arbitration Agreement.{'\n\n'}
      The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this mediation/arbitration agreement, shall be submitted exclusively first to JAMS or its successor for mandatory mediation. If all such disputes, claims or controversies are not finally resolved within sixty (60) days of submission to mediation, then all such unresolved disputes, claims or controversies shall be submitted to JAMS or its successor for final and binding mandatory arbitration in Chicago, Illinois before one arbitrator under JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures, effective July 1, 2014, or any later amendment thereof (the JAMS Rules, including the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, shall apply depending on the amount in controversy). Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from the JAMS panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by either of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may initiate arbitration with respect to the matters submitted to mediation by filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the conclusion of the mediation or at any time following sixty (60) days from the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first ("Earliest Initiation Date"). At no time prior to the Earliest Initiation Date shall either party initiate an arbitration related to this Agreement except to pursue injunctive relief or a provisional remedy in a court of applicable jurisdiction that is authorized by law or by JAMS Rules or by agreement of the parties. However, this limitation is inapplicable to a party if the other party refuses to comply with the requirements for mediation set forth herein. All applicable statutes of limitation and defenses based upon the passage of time shall be tolled until 15 days after the Earliest Initiation Date. The parties will take such action, if any, required to effectuate such tolling. Under this Agreement, each party may bring claims against the other only in that party's individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding, and in no event may the arbitrator consolidate more than one person's claims, or otherwise preside over any form of a class, collective, or representative proceeding. Judgment on the Award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator may, in the Award, allocate all or part of the costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator and the reasonable attorneys' fees of the prevailing party. Nothing in this clause shall preclude the parties from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction: i) for temporary, preliminarily or permanent injunctive relief to enjoin activities that may result in irreparable injury or harm; or ii) for provisional remedies in aid of arbitration.{'\n\n'}
      15.10 Prevailing Language.{'\n\n'}
      The English language version of this Agreement will be controlling in all respects and will prevail in case of any inconsistencies with translated versions, if any.
